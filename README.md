# Project Overview

In this project I am given a game loop engine and visual assets, using these tools I must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.


## How can you run this project?

You can view it online by going to [this Website](https://aladdinmagdy.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/).

Or simply clone this repository via git or download a zip file then open the index.html file.


## How to play the game?

You probably figured out already didn't you? Yes, Correct. By using the arrows on your keyboard you'll be able to move the character on your screen.
